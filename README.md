# Testimonials
Just a basic testimonials section you'd typically see on any site! Just trying to get some DOM practice in before I move onto more complex subjects such as React etc. Will probably complete a few more pet projects like this.

## Features

- [x] When I click the right button it will show me a new testimonials
- [x] When I click the left button it'll show me the previous review I was looking at
- [x] When I load the page it serves me a random testimonials


# Bugs

- [ ] When clicking the left arrow it takes two clicks to have the disable attribute trigger. need to figure that out
- [ ] The menu buttons for the testimonial will shrink with the content, I'd like it to be a uniform size regardless of how big the description part of the testimonial is. Most likely need to add a fixed height to the variables. Will check out tomorrow!
